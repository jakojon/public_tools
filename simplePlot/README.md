simplePlot

The idea behind simplePlot is to create simple tool that will graph a set of numbers
that came out of some benchmark data of something that runs periodically.  If it
succeeded, the benchmark would write the time (in seconds) in a unique text file.
simplePlot reads in those files and creates a line chart in time ascending order.
